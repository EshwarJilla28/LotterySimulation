# Powerball Lottery Simulation

This project simulates playing the Powerball lottery over multiple drawings to analyze the frequency of winning different prize tiers and calculate the total expenditure versus earnings. 

## Overview

The Powerball Lottery Simulation program is designed to simulate the purchase of lottery tickets and track winnings over time. It continues until the jackpot is won, tallying how often each prize tier is hit and the total expenditure versus earnings.

Key components of the simulation include:
- **Drawing Setup**: The Powerball lottery consists of 5 white balls drawn from a pool of 69 and 1 red ball (Powerball) from a pool of 26.
- **Simulation Parameters**: The user can define the number of tickets bought per drawing and the number of drawings to simulate.
- **Win Calculation**: The simulation checks the user's numbers against the winning numbers and calculates the prize based on Powerball rules.
- **Output**: After the simulation, it reports total money spent, total earnings, and the number of wins for each prize tier.
